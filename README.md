## Getting Started
The following are the procedures for downloading and training the models in this repository using modified data derived from “Machine Learning Materials Datasets”:

1. Download "Metallic_Glass_Forming_with_features2.xlsx" and "pso_svr.py" from this repository into the same directory.
2. Open cmd/terminal and change directory to dataset folder.
3. Install required packages by typing "pip install -r requirements.txt" into cmd.
4. Run "pso_svr.py" by typing "python pso_svr.py" in cmd.
